Express + Typescript API for User Management

## Description

This repository contains an Express.js and Typescript-based API focused on user management. The primary goal is to develop essential functionalities for user registration, login, email verification, password reset, and avatar management. The envisioned features include:

*   **User Registration:** Allowing users to register with the system.
*   **Login:** Authentication to access user-specific resources.
*   **Email Verification:** Sending verification emails to registered users for account activation.
*   **Password Reset:** Enabling users to reset their passwords securely.
*   **Avatar Management:** Allowing users to set and manage their profile avatars.

## Project Goals

The main goals of this project are to create a user-oriented API with the minimum set of features needed for basic user management. Future improvements may include an admin panel for user administration, although the need for this has yet to be determined.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/yevheniy-hliebov/ts-atuh-express.git
    ```
2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    $ npm install
    ```
4.  **Configure Environment Variables:**

    *   Duplicate the `.env-example` file and rename it `.env`.
    *   Fill in the necessary configuration details such as database connection, JWT secret, etc.
5.  **Run the Application:**
    ```bash
    $ npm start
    ```
## Usage

APIs can be used for a variety of purposes, such as integrating with an external application or as part of a larger system. Documentation on available endpoints and their functions will be added soon.

## Plans for the future

As the project develops, potential future features may include an admin dashboard to manage users, permissions, and other administrative tasks. The roadmap will evolve according to the changing needs of the project and its integration with other APIs.
